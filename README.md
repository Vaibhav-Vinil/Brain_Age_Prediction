# Brain Age Prediction
This repository contains the code and model for predicting brain age using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The project was developed as part of the WiDS Datathon++ University Challenge, where the goal was to analyze functional connectome matrices and build a model to estimate age.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of fMRI-derived functional connectome matrices, which represent brain connectivity patterns. The target variable is the subject's age.
